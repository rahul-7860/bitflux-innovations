Place your chosen logo file at: /mnt/data/logo.png OR update the <img> src paths in the HTML files to point to your logo location (e.g., assets/logo.png).

To run locally:
1. Save files in a folder preserving paths.
2. Open index.html in a browser. For contact form demo, JavaScript prevents real submission (demo only).

To publish:
- Upload all files to your hosting provider (shared hosting, Netlify, Vercel, or any web host).
- If you choose a domain, point its DNS to your host and upload files to the host's root.

Customization: change palette in assets/styles.css under :root variables.
